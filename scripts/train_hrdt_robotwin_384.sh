<<COMMENT
Usage Instructions:
1. Make sure you are in the correct conda environment
2. Ensure RobotWin dataset is properly extracted and accessible
3. Run: bash scripts/train_hrdt_robotwin_384.sh
4. For background execution: nohup bash scripts/train_hrdt_robotwin_384.sh > robotwin_384_train.log 2>&1 &
5. Monitor progress: tail -f robotwin_384_train.log
